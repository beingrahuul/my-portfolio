Hi, I’m <b> Kartik Kumar</b>, a passionate and dedicated <b> final-year BCA student </b> from <b> Maharaja Surajmal Institute </b> , where I’ve maintained a CGPA of <b> 9.5 </b> and secured the top rank (#1) in GGSIPU during my 4th semester. As a <b> full-stack web developer </b> , I specialize in creating responsive and visually appealing web applications, with proficiency in technologies like <b> React.js, Node.js, MongoDB, TypeScript </b>, and <b>Tailwind CSS </b>.  
<br />
<br />

I thrive on challenges and take pride in building impactful projects. Some of my notable work includes: 
<br />
<br /> 

- <b>People Care Hospital Management System</b>: A comprehensive system for managing patient records, appointments, and staff information with analytics for seamless hospital operations.  <br /> <br />
- <b>E-Learner Application</b>: A MERN-based platform for online learning with OTP-secured login, course purchase, and video tutorials.  <br /> <br />
- <b>Medical AI Platform </b>: A system for AI-assisted cancer care planning and personalized treatment recommendations.  <br /> <br />

I recently completed a two-month internship at <b> Next24Tech </b>, where I gained hands-on experience in <b> full-stack development </b> and teamwork.  

Apart from academics and projects. <br /> I’m the <b> President of the Software Development Cell (SDC) </b> and the <b> Chief Organizer for the SMART INDIA HACKATHON 2024</b> in my college. Leading teams and collaborating on real-world solutions is where I shine the most. I also have a keen interest in <b> data analysis </b> using tools like Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib.  

Driven by a constant desire to learn, grow, and innovate, I’m always looking for opportunities to contribute to meaningful projects and explore cutting-edge technologies.  

        </p>
